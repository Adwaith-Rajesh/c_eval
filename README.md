# c_eval

An overly complicated expression evaluation in C.

My fist attempt at making a proper C project

### WHy ?

Why Not?. I'm bored, I've nothing to do. And a project like is one hell of a learning experience.

### Build and Run

Make sure that you've a c compiler GCC or clang

#### Clone the repo and build the exe

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/Adwaith-Rajesh/c_eval.git
```

```commandline
cd c_eval
gcc nobuild.c -o ./nobuild
./nobuild
```

#### Now try evaluating an expression

```commandline
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh '( 3.56 * ( 20 * 3 ) + 1 )'
```

```
214.600000
```

> make sure to leave space between operators and operands

#### Bye....
